                Painting is a medium of visual expression. It does not always <br>
                 need too many colours to stand out. Mandana is one such art form <br>
                of Madhya Pradesh, which does not require tons of hues to make an impact!<br>
                It is a form of folk painting created by one of the oldest tribal <br>
                 communities of Madhya Pradesh called 'Meena'. The art is created on walls <br>
                  and floors of houses and usually done by women. This artistic form of illustration <br>
                   is  considered a representation of good luck and a method to ward off evil spirits. <br>
                The painting marks the beginning of auspicious occasions such as marriages, festivals and childbirth. <br>
                There is a particular technique to create Mandana artwork: - the wall is first coated with clay made of <br>
                 cow-dung and water. Later, it is beautified using white paint (khadiya - chalk solution) and red paint (geru - red clay). <br>
                  But with change in demand, more shades are being used to make this art colourful.  There is a unique <br>
                   brush used in the process which is made of a date stick, a clump of hair and cotton. <br>
                    The focal theme of Mandana revolves around religious and wildlife elements which 
                <br> include gods, goddesses, flowers, plants, animals and birds.
