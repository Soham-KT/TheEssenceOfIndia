                If you are curious about contemporary warli art,<br> then the warli painting's origin is fascinating. <br>
                The Warli tribe is one of the largest tribes in India, <br> located outside of the city of dreams- Mumbai. <br> 
                Warli is one of the oldest forms of Indian folk art  <br> and has its origins in the Warli region of Maharashtra. <br> 
                This form of tribal art mainly makes use of geometric shapes such as circles, <br> triangles and squares to form numerous shapes depicting life and beliefs of the Warli tribe. 
                <br> In olden days, Warli art was done on walls on special occasions. <br> The painting would be done over a brown background which would <br> basically be a mixture of mud and cow dung cakes. <br>  
                The white pigment used to draw shapes and figures would <br> be a mixture of rice mixed with water and gum. <br> One of the most popular themes in Warli art is a spiral chain <br>
                 of humans around one central motif. This in accordance with their belief <br> that life is an eternal journey, and it has no beginning and end.
